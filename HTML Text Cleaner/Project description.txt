This Java project provides an Application class that uses the PageDownloadingUtility and StringHtmlCleaner classes from the org.example package to download HTML from a given URL, clean the HTML text, and print the cleaned text to the console. The project could be useful for web scraping or data mining applications that require the extraction of plain text from HTML. The Application class contains a main method that takes a URL as a command-line argument and prints the cleaned text to the console.
