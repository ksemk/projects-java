The Delivery Profit Calculator is a Java program that calculates the profit of delivering a package either by train or by plane. The user is prompted to enter the distance in kilometers and the payment amount in PLN. The program then creates instances of the Train and Plane classes and calculates the profit for each method of delivery using the profitCalc() method. Finally, the program outputs the delivery profit for each method and also shows the difference between them. The program uses abstract classes and interfaces to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles.
