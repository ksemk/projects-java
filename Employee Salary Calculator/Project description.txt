The Employee Salary Calculator is a Java program that calculates the net salary of four types of employees - Accountant, IT Assistant, and Programmer - based on their salary, experience, and bonus rate. It takes into account the employee's experience level and calculates their bonus accordingly. The program is designed to help managers or HR departments to calculate their employees' net salary after taxes and bonuses. The program is easy to use and can be extended to include more employee types and other factors that affect their salary.
