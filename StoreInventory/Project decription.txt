StoreInventory is a Java program that demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts to manage a store's inventory. The program creates and displays items in three ways: separately, using an array, and using a collection.

The Item class is used to represent the store's products, and it has several constructors to create new objects. The class also keeps track of a unique identifier for each item, both static and non-static, and has a method to display information about the item.

The program also includes an ExpirationDate class that can be used to track the expiration date of products.

This program can be used as a starting point for developing a more sophisticated store inventory management system.
